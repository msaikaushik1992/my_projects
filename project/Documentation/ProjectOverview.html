            </header>
            <p class="matter">
                The idea behind <b>My Movies</b> is to provide its user with the
                complete information about Hollywood movies. The user can easily
                view the movie listing divided in different categories. The
                information that the user looks for, is displayed in the form of
                movie poster image

            </p>

            <p class="matter">
                In addition to basic information, essential information such as title of the movie, plot of the movie, its rating and the cast and crew
                have been provided to the user.

                <h2> Why this project?</h2>
            </header>
            <p class="matter">
                Usually, during free times I spent a lot of time to figure out which movie to watch
                and look out for specific details. I always wonder about a website
                which will combine the complete movie information from
                all the individual sources present on the web so that it won't be necessary
                for the user to visit each of the individual site and get the details.
                So I thought of doing this project.

            </header>
            <p class="matter">
                On the Home page, the user will be able to see the top fourteen boxoffice movies
            </p>
            <p class="matter">
                I have divided the complete movies into following sections:
                <ul style="margin-left:25px">
                    <li class="categories"><b>IN THEATERS</b> : Displays movies currently running in theatres</li>
                    <li class="categories"><b>COMING SOON</b> : Displays movies which are yet to come</li>
                    <li class="categories"><b>OPENING MOVIES</b>  : Displays top 25 movies according to opening</li>
                    <li class="categories"><b>TOP RENTALS</b> : Displays the current top 25 dvd rentals</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="matter">
                Based on individual interest, the user can visit the individual section
                to see the complete list of new movies in a user friendly way. The complete
                listing on each sectional page is genetrated dynamically.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p class="matter">
                <b>Search Movies:</b>
                The user can search for the specific movies from every page of the website. Based on the
                search query the user can see the dynamically populated search results and can
                choose to view individual details.
            </p>

            <p class="matter">
                <b>Movie Details:</b>
                The user can choose to view the entire detail about a specific movie. When the user clicks
                on individual movie image or movie title on any of the page the user is redirected to the movie details page.
                Here the user can view some general details like title, plot, rating and cast information

            </p>

            <p class="matter">
                <b>User Friendly Design:</b>
                The design of the website inherently provides easy navigation options.
                The user can view individual section highlights on home page itself and can
                click on links to see the detailed categorical view.
            </p>
            <p class="matter">
                <b>Responsiveness:</b>
                The entire webiste is completely responsive so that the user can view the website conveniently
                on desktop, tablets and also on mobile phones
