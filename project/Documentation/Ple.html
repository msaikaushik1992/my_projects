            Complex page like movie details page sometimes loads very slowly. The size of thumbnails fetched from API is variable
            and depending upon that sometimes it takes seconds to load a particular page properly.

            I have reduced the display of number of items like cast information and movies information being fethed from API for
            performance related matters so that the user doesn't have to wait much longer.

            Automatic google like search suggestions can be provided to the user, when the user tries
            to search for a movie based on the characters that he/she inputs.

            Complete information about the cast and crew members can be displayed to user whenever
            the thumbnail or name of any of the member is clicked
