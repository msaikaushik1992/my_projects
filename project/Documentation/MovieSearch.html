            Search functionality is one of the critical functionality supported by my website.
        </p>
        <p class="matter">
            Suppose the user wants to see the details of a particular movie, then he/she just inputs the name
            of that movie in the search box and hits enter or clicks on the "search" button image. The searchbox
            which is used for input of search query is an HTML5 search element with placeholder containing
            information and it also displays the cancel "X" icon so that the user doesn't have to remove the
            wrong input character by character.
        </p>

        <p class="matter">
            When the user hits the enter key or clicks on the "search" button image, then an ajax request is
            performed to the API. Based on the results that I get from the API, I am generating the
            movie items UI dynamically and then appending that to the Home page's UI.
        </p>
        <p class="matter">
            On the search page also, the basic movie information like movie image and its title are displayed.
        </p>

        <p class="matter">
            The jQuery file for search page is
            <a href="../../fileview/Default.aspx?~/project/Home.js" target="_blank">Home.js</a>.
            It contains all the jQuery code to fetch and display the results based on the search query.
