                The body of home page is logically
                divided into two different sections namely navigation bar and Top Box Office Movies.

                I have displayed twenty five top box office movies in the movie sections which I felt the users
                will be most interested to know about. The other categories can be visited through the links
                provided in the navigation bar. The user can then choose to view the entire movie details
                of individual movies in the top box office movies or can choose to visit other categories provided in the naviagtion bar.

            <p class="matter">
                Each individual movie information is displayed in the form of a container. It displays
                some basic information about the movie like the movie title, movie plot, its rating , cast and the thumbnail of the movie
                This container is populated dynamically with jQuery and then the click event is also added
                dynamically to that, so that when the user clicks on that, he/she will be redirected to details page to
